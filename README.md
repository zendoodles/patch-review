Upgrading Contrib to Drupal 8
-----------------------------
This session will demonstrate how to take the code from a Drupal 7 module and convert it to Drupal 8. You'll learn about many of the new Drupal core APIs that are coming down the pipe, as well as some "gotchas" to be aware of. If you start porting your modules before DrupalCon, this session can help answer questions you've encountered along the way.

The session will demonstrate porting the Pants tutorial module. webchick presented an earlier version of this session at DrupalCon Sydney, and effulgentsia presented an updated version at DrupalCon Portland.

Issue Queue Gardening: Cultivating Code and Managing those Pesky Weeds
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As of June, there were 12,745 open issues in the Drupal.org issue queue. Those issues may be anything from frightening bug report or a brilliant idea, to a problem with documentation, a duplicate of another issue, and maybe even a couple of pieces of spam.

The core contribution mentoring team has been working to refine the processes of pulling weeds and cultivating the code required to make the Drupal project go. We've learned a few things along the way, and there are many strategies which apply to managing any large project with multiple stakeholders.

In this session, we'll cover

* Triaging an incoming issue/bug report.
* The qualities of a good issue summary or description.
* Writing steps to reproduce and the value of test driven development.
* The processes we're using to find and cultivate issues.
* Helping other people navigate the jungle.
