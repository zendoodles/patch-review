pre turning them, expose everyone to bits of the mentoring process:
[can we get a covert image, like undercover, or steth?]
mentor in public, in a public channel in irc, or in a room where people can overhear interactions between mentors and participants.
seeing how mentors mentor is like training future mentors
let other people see *how* mentors</aside>

<h2>to turn regular participants into mentors:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Ask</li>
    <li>In a pinch, when there is a real need, ask (busy office hours, someone could not show up and need a replacement, at an in person sprint, ask for volunteers to do a small thing, something they would-be-mentor *is* comfortable with.</li>
    <li>give would-be mentors a first mentor task they can succeed at. For example, if a new participant is having trouble setting up webserver in linux, ask a would be mentor that you know is comfortable with that. Dont ask a would-be mentor to help someone do a Mac set up, if they dont already know. Dont ask them to help someone with a call back conversion if they have never themselves done one. Save asking them to do something they dont know the answer to for later. </li>
    <li>help without being overbearing, overhear them in their first mentoring interactions, stay around the same table, watch the conversation in irc.</li>
    <li>thank them.</li>
    <li>say one thing they did well. “you were patient when it took them 15 minutes to find their php.ini” “your explanation of interdiffs really helped that new participant”</li>

<h2>what makes a difference between a participant and a mentor?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Asking them</li>
<aside class="notes">ask mentors specifically to help in certain situations
make a manageable task for new mentors. organizing several concurrent sprints
might be too much, but asking them to mentor for 8 people in th their small
local sprint might be a good transition.</aside>

<li>Tell new mentors you will be there, and schedule a time to be available.</li>
</ul>
    <aside class="notes">For example, ask disasm, kbarsarab, vijay, shajiab, joelpittel

when they see that mentors are human and completely inept, they think that they can do it too.
for example...

        It’s about people people! making personal connections, shared experiences
        of trouble and success, fun, making it so rewarding they dont want to stop
        being involved in some way.

        asking: just outright asking someone to help/change roles when in a pinch
letting new mentors make mistakes, but being nearby
being a successful participant, learning on their level, what is needed to participant.

IRC: what’s different in irc, when there is not in-person interaction?
