Notes for reviewers
The reroll should apply and pass tests.
Make sure the participant rerolled the most recent patch.
Check the diffstat to see if the number of additions, deletions, and changed files is the same. (If they're different, look for why.)
Check to make sure all the hunks from the earlier patch are there.
Keep an eye out for unrelated changes that might have accidentally been rolled in.
