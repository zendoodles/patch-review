                        <p>Some times, a whole bunch of related issues have special review instructions.
                        <p>Like the all the schema, unused var issues. So for ones like that, make a meta to list them all to make it easy to find another once someone reviews one. Also, in the meta, put detailed insructions for what to review and how to review it, link to an example of a good review in one of the issue if one is done already. It’s like summoning any army of reviews to tackle a challenging new task. But once they do it, they can be on a mission and do it over and over.
