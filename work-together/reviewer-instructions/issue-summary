Notes for reviewers
Issue summaries should use the standard template.
You should be able to understand the issue and its current status after reading the summary.
The summary should use short, clear sentences.
It should use markup for better readability (lists, code snippets, subheaders, etc.).
It should Identify the key points rather than quoting whole paragraphs.
It can include links to particular comments if necessary, but should not only link those comments.
The UI and API changes sections can be left as "TBD"; file followup tasks for documenting these.
